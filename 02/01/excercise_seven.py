# 1. Write a python program that sums up all items in the list (all items are integers or floats in list, create a list yourself)

# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4.3, 30, 39)
# sum = sum(my_tuple)
# print(sum)
# print(type(sum))


# 2. Write a python program that multiplies all items in the list (all items are integers or floats in list, create a list yourself)

# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 30, 39)

# x = 5

# for y in my_tuple:
#     x= x * y
#     print(x)

# print(x)

# 3. Write a python program that gets maximum value from the list (all items are integers or floats in list, create a list yourself)

# my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 30, 39)

# print(max(my_tuple))


# 4. Write a python program that concatenates all strings in the list (all items are strings, create a list yourself)

# my_tuple = ("Hello", "world", "!")

# print(" ".join(my_tuple))


# 5. Create two lists and add them together, make sure it works the way you want it to.

# my_tuple = (1, 2, 33, 21, 54)
# new_tuple = (2, 44, 31, 11)

# x = my_tuple + new_tuple

# print(x)


# 6. Write a python program that asks user to enter 3 integers and find the highest value entered.

number1 =  input("Please enter first number: ")
number2 =  input("Please enter second number: ")
number3 =  input("Please enter third number: ")

tuple = (number1, number2, number3)


print(tuple)
print(max(tuple))
